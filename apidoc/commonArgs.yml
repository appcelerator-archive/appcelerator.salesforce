    Every method allows for the definition of several optional callbacks. Normally you
    will define both a `success` and an `error` callback so your application can handle
    the result of the method call.

examples:
  - title: Example of callbacks
    example: |
      The following example demonstrates the definition of all of the supported callbacks
      available on every method call. All of the callbacks are optional.

          salesforce.versions({
              success: function(results, meta) {
                  Ti.API.info('Number of versions: ' + results.length);
                  Ti.API.info(JSON.stringify(results);

                  Ti.API.info('Request time: ' + meta.time);
              },
              error: function(error, meta) {
                  Ti.API.error('ERROR:' + error.message);
              },
              progress: function(percent) {
                  Ti.API.info('Percent complete: ' + (percent * 100) + '%');
              },
              beforeSend: function(xhr) {
                  Ti.API.info('About to send request');
              }
          });
